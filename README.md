# 🛡️  Digisuraksha Cybersecurity Internship: 8-Week Practical Journey 2025

Welcome to the repository documenting my **8-week Cybersecurity Internship**, focused on hands-on learning and real-world threat analysis. Each week builds toward a solid foundation in offensive security, threat intelligence, and incident response, with tasks aligned to industry standards like **MITRE ATT&CK**, **MISP**, and **OWASP**.

---

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### 🔹 Week 1 – MITRE TTP Mapping
- Mapped **APT Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** to the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- Created and tested custom **YARA rules**
- Exported threat indicators to **MISP**
- 📸 Documented activities with screenshots

---

### 🔹 Week 2 – Malware & IOC Analysis (APT28)
- Researched the **APT28 threat group** and extracted **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
- Analyzed malware samples using public reports
- Used **HybridAnalysis** and **MISP** for IOC correlation and enrichment

---

### 🔹 Week 3 – Linux Privilege Escalation
- Completed **OverTheWire Bandit** for basic Linux privilege training
- Practiced **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)** techniques
- Compiled **cheat sheets** with practical examples and evidence

---

### 🔹 Week 4 – OSINT & Reconnaissance
- Conducted **metadata extraction** and **image geolocation tracking**
- Used OSINT tools for **passive reconnaissance**
  - Tools: **theHarvester**, **Maltego**, **SpiderFoot**, etc.
  
---

### 🔹 Week 5 – Web Exploitation
- Identified and exploited common web vulnerabilities:
  - ✅ XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - ✅ SQL Injection
  - ✅ SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- Referenced **PortSwigger (Burp Suite)** for testing and payload crafting
- Analyzed server logs for anomaly detection

---

### 🔹 Week 6 – Vulnerable Virtual Machines
- Captured flags on:
  - 🖥️ **Mr. Robot** VM
  - 🧠 **DC-1** VM
- Documented complete walkthroughs from access to root

---

### 🔹 Week 7 – Log Analysis & Incident Response
- Used **Graylog** for threat hunting and alert detection
- Reconstructed attack timeline from logs
- Built an **Incident Response (IR)** checklist and reporting templates

---

### 🔹 Week 8 – Finalization & Reporting
- Compiled reports, screenshots, and findings into a **comprehensive internship report**
- Conducted **peer reviews**
- Structured the project for clean GitHub submission
